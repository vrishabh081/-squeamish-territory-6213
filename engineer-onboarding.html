                        <h1>Reduce ramp times for new hires by 2 to 3 months</h1>

                        <p>Good onboarding improves retention. Bad onboarding ends in resignation.<br><br>

                            Based on a study of 2,500+ engineers across 4 years, we've found that although the average
                            time
                            to productivity for a new engineer is 6 – 7 months, there are also clear, measurable ways to
                            reduce that ramp time. The result? A 40% lift in productivity that occurs 2 – 3 months
                            sooner.<br><br>

                            Pluralsight enables organizations to get new engineering hires contributing to the
                            codebase—and
                            their team—faster. Leaders can coach new hires with objective data on workflow blockers,
                            bottlenecks, and skills gaps. Teams benefit from less friction in the delivery process as
                            new
                            hires join the team. And new hires are more active in the code base, more effective on the
                            team,
                            and more skilled in their role. It's a win-win-win-win (you get it).</p>
