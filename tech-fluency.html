                        <h1>Put your workforce on the path to tech fluency</h1>

                        <p>Poor tech fluency creates knowledge silos that slow innovation and dull your competitive
                            edge. A lack of organization-wide tech fluency also hinders collaboration and tech adoption.
                            But a workforce that's capable of applying deep tech concepts to the business can remove
                            barriers, have clearer conversations with better results, and contribute to business success
                            on a whole new level. <br><br>

                            Only Pluralsight's Tech Foundations provides an effective path toward tech fluency. It
                            combines expert-led courses, pre- and post-assessments, and analytics. And it fits neatly
                            into your daily work. Leaders learn what their teams know, and learners know what they need
                            to learn. Pluralsight empowers every employee, regardless of technical background, to become
                            convenient in key technologies and learn to correctly apply tech concepts for business
                            outcomes. <br><br>

                            Pluralsight creates a shared literacy that removes barriers, paves the way for
                            cross-functional dialogue, increases collaboration, and accelerates everything with any
                            touchpoint to technology.<br>
