                        <p>Agile should move you from point A to point B, faster. But the roadblocks on that journey
                            intersect people, processes, and culture, and those problems are tough to see—let alone
                            solve. <br><br>

                            Pluralsight equips software teams with objective data to identify engineering priorities and
