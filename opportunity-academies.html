                        <p>Talent exists everywhere. Opportunity doesn't. Because of this gap, there's a persistent lack
                            of diversity in tech roles. Opportunity Academies are an alternative career pathway for
                            underserved talent. <br><br>

                            Here's how it works: Pluralsight One, a social impact organization, tailors Opportunity
                            Academies for a company sponsor. Over the course of 12 – 14 weeks, each Opportunity Academy
                            on-ramps cohorts of people (sourced through partnerships with other nonprofits) from
                            underrepresented groups and prepares them for entry-level software, IT, or data roles at the
                            sponsoring company. <br><br>

                            Pluralsight creates a shared literacy that removes barriers, paves the way for
                            cross-functional dialogue, increases collaboration, and accelerates everything with any
                            touchpoint to technology.<br>
